There are several of different risks that can arise in the process of this project. For starters, we need to be aware of the merge conflicts that can arise when pushing and pulling all of our commits. With the correct protocols, we can avoid this issue. Another risk/issue that we can avoid is reaching a point where the code is unmaintainable. We can avoid this by making readable code, and following industry practices to make our lines of code as efficient and clean as possible. These precautions will not only ensure the safety and of our project, but our future projects in the work place as we instill proper programming etiquette and protocols.
